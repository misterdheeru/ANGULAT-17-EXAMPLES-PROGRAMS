    Java is a multiplatform, object-oriented programming language that can be
    used to code a variety of applications and services. It's based on C and
    C++, but is designed to be simpler to use and enforce an object-oriented
    programming (OOP) model. Java is known for its slogan, "write once, run
    anywhere" (WORA), which means that code written for one platform can be
    easily transferred to another without being completely rewritten. AWS What
